The problem we're trying to solve is the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

To solve this problem, we're using a simple algorithm that starts at a given vertex and repeatedly chooses the nearest unvisited vertex, adding it to the path until all vertices have been visited. We're keeping track of the path we've taken and the total distance traveled.

We read the input from a file, which contains a matrix of distances between cities. We then run the algorithm on this matrix to find the shortest path. Finally, we print the path taken and the total distance traveled.

Overall, this solution is a simple and effective way to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for small to medium-sized datasets. However, for larger datasets, more complex algorithms may be needed to find an optimal solution.
